You need to build the go script and updload the zip file in the lambda function by setting
as Handler the string main. To build to main.go execute the following commands in Windows:

set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64

go build -o main main.go
%USERPROFILE%\Go\bin\build-lambda-zip.exe -o main.zip main

Then you are ready to upload your lambda (main.zip file) in AWS
